  This is my blog that I will use to post my ctf writeups and projects.

Hi! My name is Jaden Wijata and I am currently in 10th grade. I go to school at Troy High School in California. My interests are mostly all cyber related things like pentesting or computer science. I compete in the ctf team [wackers](https://ctftime.org/team/157027)

Thanks for visiting!
