## Writeups

### rev/flag-checker

I implemented this simple flag checkerâ€”can you decompile it and get the right flag?

### Solution

Open in ida and follow the indexes in order and get the flag

```Flag: flag{gdb_1s_y0ur_b35t_fr13nd_6d94620fa6}```

### rev/advanced-flag-checker

Okay, maybe the last one was a little too easy. This time I've added some secret encryption techniques so that you can't find out my flag!

### Solution

Looking at the code through dogbolt's binary ninja decompiler, we can see that it is xoring different hex values together

Xor is directly reversible by performing xor again, so xor each value back together to probably get the hex of the flag

Plug the resulting hex into cyberchef, swap endianess, and go from hex

```Flag: flag{hope_you_used_z3_for_this_128c13d7}```

### rev/reverser

reverse your strings, free of charge!

### Solution

I tried doing the chall the intended way at first by reversing target back to the license key, but that didn't go so well so I moved to bruteforcing.

Remaking the check_license function to instead just return the value instead of returning if the value is equal to the target we can bruteforce character by character until the target is met.

License key: ccb85179606e3453486a4a87cf16dbf1

```Flag: flag{clock_math_too_hard}```
